# README - Google sites edition

The Google sites edition of this website cannot be uploaded here, due to an issue ripping the "new" Google sites. All other data can be downloaded, why can't this specific item have a takeout option?

Until I can download or rip the site, this directory will remain dorment (when not counting this `README.md` file)
