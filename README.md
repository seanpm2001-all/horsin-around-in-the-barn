## Editions

This is a list of 2 lists of the editions of this website:

### Google sites edition

The Google sites edition is the current live edition of the site, but it is incomplete. I am still trying to figure out how to get a digital copy of it.

You can find it [here](https://sites.google.com/view/horsin-around-in-the-barn/home/).

### HTML5 edition

The HTML5 edition is the version I created from scratch, so that I could have more functional, and control... and a digital copy.

Both versions have been developed near the same amount, this version isn't complete as well.

***

## Pet streaming

Pet streaming is a feature I am trying to figure out how to add, it is an extra option where pets kept in the stall can be live streamed to the website, so that you can check on them while you are away, and after your visit ends, you can choose to download the videos of the stream.

This feature is not very developed at the moment, and does not work.
